        <p>Dressnality is not just a brand but a vision to create an all inclusive brand for each and every body type, where we believe that beauty is not bounded by measurements and size charts. We are the brand which focuses on the needs of customers and that no one should feel that this dress is not for me because it is not available in my size or the print that I wanted. </p>
        <div className='row my-3 d-flex justify-content-space-around' style={{justifyContent: "space-around"}}><img className='img-fluid' style={{width: "40%"}} src='./Image/Types.webp'></img><img className='img-fluid' style={{width: "40%"}} src='./Image/Types2.jpg'></img></div>
        <p>In India, brands are still not aware about size inclusivity and plus size people are still neglected in ads and stores. But in Dressnality, every person is working hard to provide a dress that is made by you and exclusively made for you. We don’t want to get bounded by the standard measurement chart, but work according to customer’s demands.</p>
        <p>Our idea is unique and believes strongly in customer satisfaction which comes from treating each customer individually. Our website is easy to access and user friendly with no hassle of signing in before placing an order. Your data is safe and secure with us because it will never get saved in our database. </p>
        <p>These days’ brands are compromising of the quality of the product for increasing the profit margin, but with us you never have to worry about the quality because each and every apparel is handcrafted with loads of hardwork and love to deliver you at your doorstep. Also buying clothes can seriously burn a hole in your pocket, but we are bringing in the whole new concept of customising your clothes and that too in super affordable price range.</p>
